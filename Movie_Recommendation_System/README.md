<h3>Collaborative filtering : </h3>
<p>In this scenario, the emphasis is placed on customers and their experiences with the online platform and their opinions on products instead of the features of the items themselves. As a result, recommendation systems falling under this category leverage machine learning algorithms to gather feedback from users and comprehend what they prefer. This enables the system to suggest products other users with similar preferences purchase.

<h3>Content-based filtering : </h3>
<p>Content-based filtering in recommender systems recommends items to users based on their previous actions or preferences. It analyzes item metadata to identify items with similar characteristics to those that the user has interacted with before. This approach examines the characteristics of the items users have expressed an interest in to recommend similar items, unlike collaborative filtering, which finds similarities among users. Content-based filtering is widely used in e-commerce, news feeds, music, and movie recommendations.
